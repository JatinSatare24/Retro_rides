# Retro Rides 🏎️

**Retro Rides** is a full-stack vehicle management system designed to catalogue and track vintage automobiles. Built as part of the Scrimba Databases module, this project focuses on the integration of a persistent database layer with a Node.js backend to perform complex CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Inventory Management**: Full lifecycle management of retro car listings, including detailed specifications such as make, model, year, and engine type.
* **Relational Data Modeling**: Implements a structured database schema to handle relationships between car categories, owners, and service history.
* **Dynamic Search & Filtering**: Backend logic to query the database and filter results based on specific user criteria (e.g., "Show all muscle cars from 1969").
* **Asynchronous Data Flow**: Utilizes non-blocking I/O to ensure the server remains responsive during high-volume database queries.
* **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Robust server-side checks to prevent SQL injection and ensure data integrity before persistence.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Node.js (Core `http` module or Express.js).
* **Database**: [Insert Database here, e.g., PostgreSQL / SQLite / MongoDB].
* **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), and Semantic HTML5.
* **Data Communication**: RESTful API design using JSON for client-server exchange.
